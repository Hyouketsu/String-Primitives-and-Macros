This program takes 10 signed numbers from the user as strings, 
checks if they are valid numbers. If they are it stores the said number in 
an array of SDWORDS. If not it reprompts the user. I tried handling overflow 
and bigger numbers but I could not wrap my head around it. This program then 
takes the array and sums up the numbers and averages the numbers of the array 
and displays 1. the array as strings by conversion to string using stosb
2. the sum as a string 3. the average as a string
